## Rekop Poker - a multi-player, Android poker game

By the gods, *a new poker game!*

This project is my independent third-year software project for my dissertation, intended to showcase development methods, technologies and techniques learned over these long years.

Rekop poker will feature Texas Hold'em as its primary gamemode and hold a focus on customization of matches hosted in private. The network itself will be disconnection-tolerant, allowing the game to continue if a client disconnects and for them to join back at a later time.
