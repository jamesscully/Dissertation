\section*{Aims and Objectives}
The main aim of this project is to produce a multi-player poker card game designed for mobile phones. 
With this in mind, we have some key objectives to consider: 

\begin{itemize}
	\item A history of scores should be kept on the user interface
	\item A history of hands dealt should be kept on the user interface
	\item If a user disconnects, the game should continue on.
	\item Hands that are given out should not be predictable, i.e. complete randomness (not time-based seeds)
	
\end{itemize}

\section*{Work plan}


\textbf{Research // 11 Oct - 15 Oct} - what frameworks are going to be used? How difficult is each framework to adapt to our needs? How will the server be hosted, how can we avoid predictable card behaviour?\\


\textbf{Planning // 15 Oct - 22 Oct } - software specification; class diagrams, how the game will be structured, how we're going to implement the server, how the server will handle randomness/entropy.

At this stage, we should also design wireframes for the menu, in-game, joining a server, etc. \\


\textbf{Development // 22 Oct - Feb } -
